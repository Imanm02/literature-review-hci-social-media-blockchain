# A Literature Review on HCI and Blockchain-Based Social Media

This repository includes lists of papers, short descriptions, and a link for each on a set of CS topics related to HCI and Blockchain-Based Social Media. The lists are by no means exhaustive. All the data are collected by a human (me) without using crawlers or automated software. The lists can help you - as a researcher - get ideas for the possible citations and related work for your paper and find the previous job on your desired topic. In addition to the terms and conditions in the license file, you must cite this repository if you cite any paper in the lists in this repository after looking at the list. Also, you're not allowed to write any survey or literature review based on the collected papers in this repository; the only papers permitted to use and cite in this repository are research papers, which can use the provided lists while writing the "Related Work" section.

The sentences used for introducing the papers are not necessarily the title of the documents; whenever I thought an excerpt from the abstract (or in open access papers, the body of the article) could describe what the publication is about, I've used the section (in some cases, modified a bit) as the title for the link. Some articles may be duplicates if the paper specifies multiple essential points to discuss. You should look at each piece before using them as a citation, and the lists have no guarantee to be correct, so use the contents of this repository at your own risk.

This repository is a work in progress. You can open a pull request if any description needs to be revised or corrected or if you want to add or suggest other papers and resources.
